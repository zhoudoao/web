I am a Ph.D student of a 985 university. I am broadly interested in advancing science and intelligence, where the ideas invovle probability, neural networks and cloud computing.

I like to work simultaneously on fundamental research as well as systems to accelerate this research. I always think about things from top to down, but do things from bottom to up. As to my point of view, systematic thinking is very import to a project, which can make it much eaier to debug, extend and be flexible.
